# Disease Prediction Model
This project involves developing a disease prediction model using machine learning. The model focuses on predicting health conditions, specifically diabetes, based on health indicators. The ultimate goal is to integrate the model into a web application for easy accessibility.

## Project Overview
Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset containing health indicators relevant to diabetes prediction.
Objective: To create an accurate and efficient machine learning model capable of predicting diabetes risk based on input health parameters.
Integration: Once complete, the model will be integrated into a web application to allow users to input their health details and receive predictions.
Project Files
diabetes_health_indicators.csv: The dataset used for model training and testing.
diabetes_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, training, and evaluation.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and performs feature engineering.
Model Training: Tests multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for comprehensive performance analysis.
